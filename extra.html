    <p class="wolf"> 
        I see a costume as a way to dress up as something you love; for example, a pirate or a werewolf. But you can also do many different themes of clothing for a costume; 1930's, steampunk, etc.

                Themes are always an important thing in thinking of a costume. You could do a videogame character, or maybe a character in a show/movie! The possibilities are endless, you just have to put time and effort into what you are wanting to do!
